You will need to import the classicmodels database from mysqlsampledatabase.sql
using MySQL workbench before you start working on this assignment.

For the questions, put your SQL query first and your output second.

6. Write a PHP program that prints the following information to the terminal:
The customer name, country, and sales rep name on one line per customer.
Order the results by country first and customer name second.
See assignment_3_solution_output.txt for what the output should look like.
assignment_3.php contains most of the code you need to complete the assignment.
You will need to write the SQL query and write the output.
You should use only 1 SQL query to the database.

      // Fetch each row of the query result as an associative array.
